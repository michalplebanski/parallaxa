TITTLE: Parallaxa

TECHNOLOGIES USED: html5, css3, jQuery

DESCRIPTION: In this project I used very nice-looking effect - I "glued" the pictures
by using properties "fixed" which made the parallax effect. Simple trick but
the simplest ones are the best. There is also an animate for each text (the best effect
is when a user clicks on the navigation) + scroll effect. For a text animate I used
an external file from Animate.css.
